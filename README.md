## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) installed.

### Running the Code in Visual Studio Code

1. **Open VS Code**: Launch Visual Studio Code.

2. **Open the Project**: Use `File > Open Folder...` to open the folder containing your Python script.

3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)**:
   - Open a terminal in VS Code (Terminal > New Terminal).
   - Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows:
       ```bash
       venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On macOS/Linux:
       ```bash
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```

4. **Install Dependencies** (if any): If your code has dependencies, you can install them using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
